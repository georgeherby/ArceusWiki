Introduction

Hi and welcome to the wiki for our Pokémon Go scanning service. We currently have three discord servers:

PoGo Sussex
PoGo HomeCounties
PoGo London

I guess you know about at least one of them having made your way here. If you need an invite to any of our other discord servers, just ask in the chat channel.

To see which locations we scan in each server, the readme will provide te information. There are screenshots and lists of areas there.

All are welcome here, but only raid channels are availble for free. Providing this service costs a lot of money, so to get access to the scanning channels, 
the map or any of our bots you must subscribe to this service. The cost is currently £3 a month, but you can pay anything from £1 for 10 days of access upwards. 
We do ask that you do not subscribe too far into the future, as given this service is against the Niantic terms and conditions, there is always a chance
that this service could be closed down without much notice, and refunds will not be processed should this happen.

To subscribe to this service, please read the **Guzzlord** subscription section.

Our Bots
###############

We have a few bots on our discord servers to help make your experience with us better and to help you find the pokemon you are looking for:

1. Guzzlord - This bot is your tool to activate and maintain your subscription. Guzzlord is also used to assist with some other basic commands.
2. Arceus - This is our pokemon alerting bot. Use this to set up alerts, filtered exactly how you want, for the locations you want.
3. Dialga - This is our raid bot. Use Dialga to set up raid alerts for the areas or gyms of interest to you. Dialga is also used to set up and attend raid battles.
4. Shaymin - To let others know of nests in your area, use Shaymin.
5. Prof Oak - The professor is your one stop shop to get info on all things PoGo. From finding out which egg a pokemon appears in to calculating IVs for your catches, the professor will help.

Help!
#####

If you see someone asking questions that is answered in here, feel free to direct them here, or if you can, provide assistance yourself. We are a community and we help each other.
Arceus & Dialga can seem daunting at first, so let's help those that are new here :)
