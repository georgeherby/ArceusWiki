Introduction
************

Ever thought “I wish i could stop those pesky Skarmory or Mantine
notifications”, or “I just want notifications for that elusive Unown”.
Well we have the answer!

Using our bots Arceus & Dialga you can now configure alerts to your
personal message inbox for specific pokemon or raids for certain areas.
So whether you are only able to get to a small area or able to tour
around the county after those rares it can be configured to suit your
needs!

This function searches for posts in the server and resends them to you
in a DM. This means that the filters applied on the server will apply to
the DMs too.

*You need to be a Subscriber to get this feature - please see the
subscribe channel on discord for further details*

Getting Started
###############

Once you have joined one of the below servers (mentioned in ***current
servers*** section), assigned yourself some area roles and subscribed go
to the #bot-commands channel type one of the following command:

``!alert`` - for pokemon alerts ``!raid`` - for raid alerts

This will trigger a DM (direct message) from Arceus (for pokemon) or
Dialga (for raids). Once you have got the message open it and from here
all commands that you need to use must be entered in here. A page of all
commands is below.

-  `Pokemon Alerts`_

   -  `Location Settings`_

-  `Raid Alerts`_

Note: if you lose a DM with the bots just run ``!alert`` or ``!raid``
again in #bot-commands and you’ll get another DM, no need to reset up
your settings they will be remembered in the bots bulging brain!

Invite Code
###########

Once you are on the server if you want to give someone else the invite
code just use the invite command and Arceus will send it to you

::

    !invite

Raid Meetups
############

Dialga now also has the ability to set up raid meetups for you and
organise your raids :)

Each area has an -activeraids channel. All level 4 & 5 (level 1-3 are
soloable and do not need meetups) raids are posted here for you to set
up meetups. To help you familiarise yourself with the commands needed to
set these up, click `here`_.
