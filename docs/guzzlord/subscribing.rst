Why Should I Subscribe?
#######################

There are many reasons why subscribing is possibly the best thing you could ever do :smiley: Not only do you get the warm fuzzy feeling from knowing that your support is keeping this service running, 
but you also get ALL of the following goodies!!

~ Access to the scan channels to see what is spawning in the areas you want to know about  
~ Access to the map  
~ Access to use Arceus & Dialga, our amazing alerting bots (see :doc:`Arceus </arceus/intro>` or :doc:`Dialga </dialga/intro>`)  

Cost of Subscription
####################

The cost is currently £3 a month, but you can pay anything from £1 for 10 days of access upwards. 
We do ask that you do not subscribe too far into the future, as given this service is against the Niantic terms and conditions, there is always a chance
that this service could be closed down without much notice, and refunds will not be processed should this happen.

How To Subscribe
################

Make Payment
============ 

Make a payment via `PayPal <http://bit.ly/2igVOxV>`_. Make note of the transaction ID for the payment.

.. note::

	Payment can only be made in GBP, and must have a value of at least £1. Anything less will be rejected by Guzzlord. Also, payments cannot be processed until marked as 'Complete' in PayPal.

Apply Payment
=============

Go to the bot-commands channel and type:

.. code-block:: bash

    !subscribe
	
In DM with Guzzlord, type:
 
.. code-block:: bash

    !transction ID

where ID is the transaction ID you noted in step 1. If the transaction ID is correct and found on `PayPal <http://bit.ly/2igVOxV>`_, you will receive a response with your new subscription expiry date.

.. note::

	Please remember, if you are subscribing again after expiring, your map credentials will have changed. 
 
Get Map Credentials
===================

Type:

.. code-block:: bash

    !map
	
In DM with Guzzlord to get the URL of the map, and your credentials for logging onto the map. If desired you can also change your password (see below)

Expiration
==========

You will be sent a reminder 3 days before your subscription expires and again once it does. Should your subscription expire, your map credentials will be deleted, your bot rights will be revoked
and you will no longer be able to see the scan channels. Your alerts will not be deleted until you leave the server in case you decide to re-subscribe.

Useful Commands 
###############

.. code-block:: bash

    !change_password password
	
If you want to change your map password to soemthing shorter or more memorable.

.. note::

    Passwords are stored in the DB as plain text. Please do not use a password that you use elsewhere.
	
.. code-block:: bash

If you want to check your expiry date, use this command. 

.. code-block:: bash
