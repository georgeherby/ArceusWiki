Why Should I Subscribe?
#######################

There are many reasons why subscribing is possibly the best thing you could ever do :) Not only do you get the warm fuzzy feeling from knowing that your support is keeping this service running, 
but you also get ALL of the following goodies!!

* Access to the scan channels to see what is spawning in the areas you want to know about  
* Access to the map  
* Access to :doc:`Arceus </arceus/intro>`, our pokemon alert bot (for pokemon subscribers). This can be customised to alert you for pokemon based on location, IV, CP, Level and more.
* Access to :doc:`Dialga </dialga/intro>`, our raid alert bot. This can be customised to alert you to raids in your chosen area or at specific gyms.

Cost of Subscription
####################

We have implemented a new subscription model, so you can choose to sign up to what you want to get:
£3 per 30 days this gives you access to all Pokemon and Quests scans, plus the map and Arceus and Dialga for personal Pokemon and Raids alerts

What If I Do Not Have PayPal?
=============================

Unfortunately we only accept PayPal as a form of payment for subscription. We have found that 99% of people do have and are happy to use PayPal and we cannot process any other form of payment.
If you cannot use PayPal at all, our only suggestion is to liaise with a fellow PoGo player or friend that does use PayPal, and ask them to do it for you if you pay them.
