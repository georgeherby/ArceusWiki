Introduction
============

Arceus is our alerting bot. Once you have alerts set up for the Pok√©mon you want to know about, in the areas you want to know about, you could mute all scan channels knowing that you will receive a notification should anything worthwhile spawn.

There are two types of alert:

#. **Distance based alerts**. See the :doc:`Location Alerts </arceus/location_alerts>` page, but in summary users can set up locations and then create alerts within distances of that location.
#. **Channel based alerts**. All our spawns are posted to area channels (see :ref:`roles`), and you can set up alerts for the whole channel, or areas within the channel.

Based on which discord server you have joined, you may find that not both options are unavilable to you:

* **London** - Only distance based alerts are possible here. Due to the sheer number of users in an area, adding channel wide alerts just isn't possible without breaking Arceus :(
* **Sussex / HomeCounties** - Because the userbase is spread out over a much wider area, channel alerting does not break Arceus and is therefore enabled.

.. warning::

	The bot uses the posts in the scan channels, so please check the **filter** channel to see what is sent to discord. There is no point setting up an alerts for all Swablu for example, when only 100% IV are posted to discord.
