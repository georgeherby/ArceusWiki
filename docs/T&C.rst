Rules
#####

We only have a few rules, we expect everyone to be respectful to admin and to other members. If you have any disputes, DM them to any admin or if you wish to have a ‘heated’ discussion with another individual take it to the DMs otherwise all involved will be removed from the discord. 
We will not get involved in local disputes. Banter is always welcome, just be mindful of language in the long term as there may be children on here going forward but in general we have no issue with swearing. 

There is ZERO TOLERANCE on physical or verbal abuse; our first response will ALWAYS be to tell the victim to call the police. 
Individuals who have been witnessed being abusive or we receive evidence of you breaking this rule you will be removed from the discord permanently.

Spoofing
--------

The general rule is DON’T talk about it full stop on our discord, don’t accuse anyone of it (this includes joystick reacts), don’t discuss it at all. 
If you have SOLID evidence of someone spoofing, DM an admin and we will deal with it. 
We aren't here to police it that's Niantic's job but we don't want it discussed as a topic full stop on our discord. 
If you are spoofing, don’t talk about it – otherwise you will be removed.  

Account sharing
---------------

There is no issue here, get over it. It's a game. Not your issue (or most importantly ours!), don't start arguments over it. 
This is a non-issue as far as we're concerned. Don't want pointless arguments about it, if you start one you’ll be removed.

Scan Sharing
------------

**THIS IS OUR NUMBER 1, MOST IMPORTANT RULE**

* Sharing of scan of any data from Arceus, including IVs, screenshots, map images and coordinates in various social media channels will result in being kicked from the server, requiring you to re-join and re-subscribe. Scans are for personal use only!!
* Do not share your map credentials. We log every visit to the map and usage is monitored. Overly excessive use over many multiple devices will result in a ban. Trusted individuals on the discord have had access to the map for a while now, we have tested this and know when you're sharing map credentials.  
* It is very important that the above is adhered to, breaking the above rules will result in an initial warning and kicking from the discord; repeated misuse will result in a permanent ban. 
* If we see constant rule-breaking of the above from multiple individuals, we will turn off scans for that area until we are confident that it will no longer be an issue. 

You guys and girls pay for this service, so those that don’t shouldn’t be given the same privileges as the members who contribute to keeping this service going and hopefully expanding. 

Service Level Agreeement
########################

We will guarantee a level of service and extend expiration dates for extended downtime inside of our control.

Should the scans go down for longer than 12 hours, we will add time to your expiration date to cover the downtime. 
This does not cover downtime due to a new API being forced by Niantic as this is outside of our control. Usually, a new API is cracked within a few hours so this shouldn't be an issue anyway. 

As you are paying for a service, we will guarantee that the admin team will be available at weekends in case of issues. Should scans go down, feel free to contact us, or post in the isscandown channel in discord and we will investigate and fix immediately, provided it isn't 4am when we are asleep!
